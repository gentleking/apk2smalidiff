-This is a Test! #var

-The test is how to compare. v1

-The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way; v2

-The name that can be named is not the eternal name. v3

-The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;

-The Named is the mother of all things.

-Therefore let there always be non-being,

+The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; #var

+The named is the mother of all things. v2

+

+The test is how to compare. v3

+Therefore let there always be non-being, v4

   so we may see their subtlety,

 And let there always be being,

   so we may see their outcome.

 The two are the same,

 But after they are produced,

-  they have different names.
+  they have different names.

+They both may be called deep and profound.

+Deeper and more profound,

+The door of all subtleties!

+This is a Test!
