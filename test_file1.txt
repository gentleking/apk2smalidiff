This is a Test! v0
The test is how to compare. v1
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way; v2
The name that can be named is not the eternal name. v3
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Therefore let there always be non-being,
  so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
  so we may see their outcome.
The two are the same,
But after they are produced,
  they have different names.
